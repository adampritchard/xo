✔ split react components into files
✔ move initWebSocketServer into own file
✔ can I also run an express server on another port??
✔ try sharing data between the api and websockets...
✔ setup start and room routes
✔ join room messages
✔ setup actual rooms
✔ 'room-full' message
✔ 'room-not-found' message

✔ ditch the ping count stuff
✔ split server into 'api' and 'websockets' folders

- no winner

- remove rooms after timeout (room will self destruct in ...)
- disconnect everyone when room is removed

- setup a Board class (checkWinner, isCellEmpty(row, col), setCell(row, col))

- set up a ping that triggers close if no pong

- 'Waiting for another player' message
